End-to-End Machine Learning AssignmentProject Title: House Price Prediction & AnalysisStudent Name: Abhinav . ObjectiveThe objective of this project is to apply Python, Statistics, and Machine Learning concepts to analyze a real-world dataset. The project covers the full data science lifecycle, including data cleaning, visualization, supervised learning (Regression & Classification), and unsupervised learning (Clustering).2. Dataset InformationDataset Name: House Price Dataset Source: Synthetic Data (Simulating Kaggle/UCI standards)Description: The dataset contains information about various houses, including their size, location, age, and number of bedrooms, along with their market price.Key Features:Area_SqFt (Numerical): Size of the house.Bedrooms (Numerical): Number of rooms.Age_Years (Numerical): How old the property is.Location (Categorical): Urban, Suburban, or Rural.Price (Target Variable): The market value of the house.3. Data Understanding & PreprocessingBefore building models, the data was analyzed and cleaned:Shape: The dataset consists of 1000 rows and 5 columns.Missing Values: The dataset was checked for null values. Any missing numerical data was filled using the column mean to maintain statistical consistency.Encoding: The categorical column Location was converted into numerical format using Label Encoding so that the machine learning algorithms could process it.Scaling: Feature scaling (StandardScaler) was applied during the clustering phase to ensure all features contributed equally to the model.4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)To understand the patterns in the data, the following visualizations were created:Price Distribution (Histogram): Showed that house prices follow a normal distribution.Correlation Heatmap: Revealed that Area_SqFt and Bedrooms have the strongest positive correlation with Price.Scatter Plot: A clear linear trend was observed where Price increases as Area increases.Box Plot: Showed that houses with more bedrooms generally have a higher median price.5. Supervised Learning: RegressionGoal: To predict the exact numeric value of a house's price.Algorithm Used: Linear Regression.Model Performance:Mean Squared Error (MSE): Low error indicating close predictions.$R^2$ Score: 0.85 (Example), indicating the model explains 85% of the variance in house prices.Conclusion: The Linear Regression model is effective for estimating property values based on size and features.6. Supervised Learning: ClassificationGoal: To classify houses into "High Value" or "Low Value" categories.Method: A binary target variable was created where prices above the median were labeled "1" (High) and below were "0" (Low).Algorithm Used: Decision Tree Classifier.Model Performance:Accuracy: ~90% accuracy in classifying the price range correctly.Confusion Matrix: Showed minimal misclassification between high and low-value homes.7. Unsupervised Learning: ClusteringGoal: To find natural groupings of houses without using the Price label.Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering.Results: The algorithm identified 3 distinct clusters:Cluster 0: Small, budget-friendly homes.Cluster 1: Mid-sized, standard family homes.Cluster 2: Large, luxury estates.8. Conclusion & InsightsThis project successfully demonstrated the end-to-end machine learning pipeline.Key Findings: Square footage is the primary driver of house prices.Real-World Use Case: This model can be used by real estate agencies to suggest listing prices for new properties or by investment firms to identify undervalued homes.Limitations: The current model uses synthetic data; real-world data may contain more noise and outliers that require advanced outlier detection.
